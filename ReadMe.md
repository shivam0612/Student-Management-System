# Student Management System

The Student Management System is a comprehensive project developed using cross-platform technologies, combining Asp.net (C#) for web development and Android for mobile applications.

## Features

- **Academic Details Tracking:** Keep a record of student attendance, marks, profiles, and other relevant academic information.
- **Document Management:** Easily access and manage documents such as handbooks and timetables.

## Components

### Web Application (Asp.net - C#)

The web application, developed in Asp.net, is dedicated to the management side of the system. Teachers and administrators (HOD) can efficiently update student records, facilitating smooth academic operations.

### Android Application

The Android app serves as the user interface for students and faculty members. It allows users to view academic records and communicate with respective faculty members for any queries.

## Communication Protocol

The Android app is developed using the SOAP protocol, ensuring robust and secure data communication between the mobile application and the server. This protocol enhances data exchange reliability in the Student Management System.

## Technologies Used

- **Web Development:** Asp.net (C#) [SMS DIRECTORY]
- **Mobile App Development:** Android [XPDITE DIRECTORY]
- **Communication Protocol:** SOAP
